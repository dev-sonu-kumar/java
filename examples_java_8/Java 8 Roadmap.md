**Java 8 Roadmap**

1. **Review Core Java Concepts (Optional, For Short Recap)**

   - Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
   - Exceptions, Collections Framework, Threads

2. **Get Familiar with Java 8 Features**

   - Lambda Expressions
   - Functional Interfaces
   - Streams API
   - Method References
   - Default and Static Methods in Interfaces
   - Optional Class
   - Date and Time API (java.time package)

3. **Hands-on Coding Practice**

   - Write Lambda expressions for different use-cases
   - Create and implement custom functional interfaces
   - Use Stream API for filtering, mapping, reducing collections
   - Refactor existing code to replace anonymous classes (Runnable, Comparator) with lambdas
   - Handle null safely using Optional

4. **Project-based Learning**

   - Build a console-based app (e.g., Contact Manager) using Streams, lambdas, functional interfaces
   - Refactor small parts of your old codebase with Java 8 features

5. **Deep Dive into Streams**

   - Learn about intermediate and terminal operations
   - Work with parallel streams
   - Performance considerations

6. **Explore Advanced Java 8 Features**

   - New collectors (toMap, groupingBy, etc.)
   - Custom collectors
   - FlatMap, reduce, and advanced stream operations

7. **Best Practices & Real-world Examples**

   - Learn when to use (and not to use) streams and lambdas for better maintainability
   - Performance and readability tips

8. **Test, Debug, and Document**
   - Use unit tests for lambda-heavy code
   - Debug stream pipelines
   - Document new paradigms for your team
