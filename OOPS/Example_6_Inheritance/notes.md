✅ What is Inheritance?
Inheritance lets a class (child) inherit fields and methods from another class (parent).
This helps with code reuse and building relationships like “is-a”.

🔸 Terminology:
Superclass (Parent/Base) – the class being inherited from.

Subclass (Child/Derived) – the class that inherits.

🔥 Benefits of Inheritance:
Reuse common logic (like eat() and sleep() in all animals).

Easier maintenance and extension.

Supports hierarchical structure (e.g., Animal → Dog, Cat, Bird).

🧠 Types of Inheritance in Java:

Type Example
Single - Dog extends Animal
Multilevel - Puppy extends Dog extends Animal
Hierarchical - Dog, Cat extend Animal

Java doesn't support multiple inheritance (one class from two parents) with classes — but it does with interfaces.
