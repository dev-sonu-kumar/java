# Master Java Collections: Understanding Collection Hierarchy Simplified

## What is a Collection?
- A **Collection** in Java is a group of objects or elements.
- Examples: coins, bottle caps, strings, numbers, objects.

## Before the Collection Framework
- Java (before version 1.2) used classes like `Vector`, `Stack`, `Hashtable`, and arrays.
- Drawbacks:
  - Inconsistency and lack of interoperability.
  - Difficult to use for generic programming.

## Introduction of the Collection Framework
- Java 1.2 introduced the **Collection Framework**.
- Advantages:
  - Interoperability among collection classes.
  - Standardized interfaces.
  - Easier generic programming.

## Collection Framework Structure

### Root Interfaces
- **Iterable**: Enables ‚Äúforeach‚Äù loop.
- **Collection**: Extends `Iterable`, main root for collections.

### Main Interfaces and Their Implementations
| Interface | Description | Implementations       |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| List      | Ordered, allows duplicates | `ArrayList`, `LinkedList` |
| Set       | Unique elements only       | `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`|
| Queue     | FIFO principle             | `PriorityQueue`           |
| Deque     | Double-ended queue         | `ArrayDeque`              |
| Map       | Key-value pairs            | `HashMap`, `SortedMap`, `ConcurrentMap` |

### Hierarchy Overview
- Interfaces at the top, classes implement interfaces.
- `Deque` and `BlockingQueue` are under `Queue`.
- `Map` is separate from `Collection`.

## Key Concepts
- **Interfaces** provide blueprints for basic operations.
- Cannot instantiate interfaces directly; must use implementing classes.
- Implementing classes define methods specified by interfaces.

# ArrayList Explained: Master Java's Dynamic Arrays in Minutes!

## List Interface Overview
- The **List** interface extends `Collection`.
- Key features:
  - Preserves order of elements
  - Allows duplicate elements
  - Supports index-based access

---

## ArrayList Class

- Implements the `List` interface.
- Dynamic resizing ‚Äì grows/shrinks as needed.
- Useful when you don‚Äôt know the number of elements in advance.

### Features
- **Dynamic size**: Automatically adjusts as you add or remove items.
- **Indexed access**: Retrieve elements by their index, like arrays.
- **Duplicates allowed**: The same value can appear multiple times.
- **Generics support**: Specify the type of elements it will contain.

### Core Operations & Methods

```
// Creating an ArrayList
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(); // Default initial capacity = 10

// Adding elements
list.add(1);           // Add to end
list.add(0, 5);        // Add at index 0

// Removing elements
list.remove(0);        // Remove item at index 0
list.remove(Integer.valueOf(1)); // Remove first occurrence of object

// Replacing elements
list.set(0, 50);       // Set index 0 to value 50

// Accessing elements
int value = list.get(0); // Get value at index 0

// List size
int size = list.size();

// Iteration
for (int i : list) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

// Search/Check existence
list.contains(50);

// Convert to array
Integer[] arr = list.toArray(new Integer);

// Sorting
Collections.sort(list);

// Trim storage
list.trimToSize();
```

---

### Internal Mechanics

- **Backed by a dynamic array**
    - Starts with capacity 10 (default).
    - Grows by 1.5x if capacity exceeded.
    - When resized, all elements are copied to a new, larger array.
    - Removing items shifts elements to fill the gap.
- **Capacity vs. Size**
    - *Capacity*: Internal array size (how much it can hold before resize).
    - *Size*: Number of elements actually in the list.
- **Presetting capacity** (optimization, saves resizing):
    ```
    ArrayList<Integer> bigList = new ArrayList<>(1000);
    ```

---

### Other List Creation Methods

- `Arrays.asList()`: Fixed-size list backed by the array; can‚Äôt add/remove elements, but can replace.
- `List.of()` (Java 9+): Creates an unmodifiable list.
- To make modifiable, wrap with new list:
    ```
    List<String> modifiable = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"));
    ```

---

### Time Complexity Table

| Operation         | Average/Best Case     | Worst Case           |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Get (by index)    | O(1)                 | O(1)                 |
| Add (end)         | O(1) (amortized)     | O(n) (if resizing)   |
| Remove (by index) | O(n)                 | O(n)                 |
| Iteration         | O(n)                 | O(n)                 |

---

> **ArrayList** is the most commonly-used dynamic array implementation in Java. It provides indexed access, dynamic resizing, supports generics, and offers handy methods for common tasks. Understanding its mechanism is essential for high-performance Java code.

Here are carefully summarized notes from **"Java Comparator Made EASY! üî• Learn Object Sorting Like a Pro"** in GitHub-friendly markdown (`Java_Comparator_Notes.md`):

```markdown
# Java Comparator Made EASY! üî• Learn Object Sorting Like a Pro

## Overview
- **Comparator** is a Java interface used for custom sorting.
- Allows sorting objects by custom logic, different from natural ordering.

---

## Core Concepts

### What is Comparator?
- An **interface** for defining custom order.
- Used with sorting methods (`sort`) to specify how objects should be compared and ordered.

### Default vs. Custom Sorting
- **Default/natural sorting**: If no Comparator is given, sorting is based on default object order (e.g., numbers ascending, strings lexicographically).
- **Custom sorting**: Use Comparator to sort objects based on length, descending order, custom fields, etc.

---

## Creating a Comparator

### 1. Implement Comparator Interface (Classic Approach)
```
class StringLengthComparator implements Comparator<String> {
    public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
        return s1.length() - s2.length(); // Ascending by length
    }
}
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("date", "apple", "banana");
words.sort(new StringLengthComparator());
```

### 2. Use Lambda Expression (Modern Java)
```
words.sort((a, b) -> a.length() - b.length());    // Ascending by length
words.sort((a, b) -> b.length() - a.length());    // Descending by length
```

### 3. Built-in Comparators (Java 8+)
```
// Sort students by GPA, then by Name
students.sort(
    Comparator.comparing(Student::getGpa)
              .thenComparing(Student::getName)
);

// For descending order
students.sort(
    Comparator.comparing(Student::getGpa).reversed()
);
```

---

## How compare() Works
- Returns a negative integer: first argument comes before second.
- Returns zero: both are considered equal in order.
- Returns a positive integer: first argument comes after second.

---

## Example: Sorting Custom Objects

```
class Student {
    String name;
    double gpa;
    // Constructors and getters
}

List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
students.add(new Student("Alice", 3.5));
students.add(new Student("Bob", 3.7));
students.add(new Student("Charlie", 3.5));

// Sort by GPA descending
students.sort((a, b) -> Double.compare(b.getGpa(), a.getGpa()));

// Sort by GPA ascending, then by Name
students.sort(Comparator.comparing(Student::getGpa)
                        .thenComparing(Student::getName));
```

---

## Handy Tips
- For numbers: `o1 - o2` for ascending, `o2 - o1` for descending.
- For strings: `s1.compareTo(s2)` (lexicographical, ascending), `s2.compareTo(s1)` for descending.
- Use lambda for most concise custom logic.

---

## Chaining Comparators

- Use `thenComparing` to chain by multiple attributes:
    ```
    Comparator<Student> comp = Comparator.comparing(Student::getGpa)
                                         .thenComparing(Student::getName);
    students.sort(comp);
    ```

---

> The **Comparator** interface empowers you to sort collections however you want! Whether sorting by one field, multiple fields, or using complex logic, Comparator is essential for mastering professional Java development.

# Complete Java LinkedList Tutorial for Beginners (With Coding Examples)

## What is LinkedList?

- **LinkedList** is a class in Java Collection Framework, implements the `List` interface.
- Unlike **ArrayList** (which uses a backing array with contiguous memory), LinkedList uses nodes.
    - Each node holds:
        - `data` (the value to store)
        - `pointer/reference` to the next node

## Types of LinkedLists

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node, except the last node (which points to `null`).
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both next and previous nodes. First node's previous, and last node's next, point to `null`.
- **Circular Linked List**: Last node points back to the first. Can be singly or doubly linked.

---

## Internal Structure Example

```
class Node {
    int value;
    Node next;
    // For doubly linked: Node prev;
}
```

- Data and reference to the next node.
- In doubly linked list, also keeps reference to previous node.

---

## Key LinkedList Operations & Methods

```
LinkedList<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();
linkedList.add(1);           // Add at end
linkedList.addFirst(0);      // Add at beginning
linkedList.addLast(2);       // Add at end
linkedList.add(1, 5);        // Add at index
linkedList.get(1);           // Get value at index
linkedList.removeFirst();    // Remove first element
linkedList.removeLast();     // Remove last element
linkedList.remove(1);        // Remove at index
linkedList.removeIf(x -> x % 2 == 0); // Remove all even elements (Java 8+)
```

### Bulk and Conditional Operations

- `removeAll(Collection<?> c)`: Removes all matching elements from the list.
- `clear()`: Removes all elements.

---

## Performance Characteristics

| Feature                          | LinkedList                   | ArrayList                |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Random Access (get by index)      | Slow (O(n))                  | Fast (O(1))              |
| Insert/Delete (start, mid, end)   | Fast (O(1) for ends)         | Slow at start mid (O(n)) |
| Memory Usage                      | More (stores extra pointers) | Less                     |

- Access by index requires traversal from head (no direct indexing).
- Efficient for frequent insertions/removals anywhere in the list.
- Higher memory overhead due to storing references.

---

## LinkedList as List, Queue, and Stack

- Can behave as a **List**, **Queue** (FIFO), **Stack** (LIFO), depending on method usage.
- Example:  
    - Queue: `addLast()`, `removeFirst()`
    - Stack: `addFirst()`, `removeFirst()`

---

## How to Create on the Fly

```
LinkedList<String> animals = new LinkedList<>(Arrays.asList("cat", "dog", "elephant"));
animals.removeAll(Arrays.asList("dog", "lion")); // Remove all matching items
```

---

> **LinkedList** in Java is a flexible, powerful data structure for insertions and deletions with trade-offs in memory and access times. It can represent Lists, Queues, and Stacks, making it ideal for many real-world scenarios.

```markdown
# Java Vectors Made SUPER Easy! üî• Beginner's Guide

## What is Vector?

- **Vector** is a legacy class in Java (`java.util`), implements the `List` interface.
- Introduced before Collection Framework; now integrated into it.
- **Thread-safe** (all methods are synchronized).
    - Makes Vector suitable for multi-threaded environments.
    - Synchronization adds overhead; not recommended in single-threaded scenarios (use ArrayList instead).

---

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Array**: Like ArrayList, Vector grows in size as elements are added.
- **Synchronization**: All methods are thread-safe.
- **Legacy Class**: Originates from JDK 1.0 (pre-collection framework).
- **Random Access**: Accessing by index is fast (O(1)), similar to arrays.

---

## Constructors and Capacity

```
// Default constructor (capacity 10)
Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>();

// Constructor with initial capacity
Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>(12);

// Constructor with initial capacity and capacity increment
Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>(5, 3);

// Create from collection
Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>(Arrays.asList(2, 3, 4));
```

- Capacity is how many elements Vector can store before resizing.
- If size exceeds capacity:
    - **Default**: Capacity doubles each time.
    - **Custom increment**: Capacity grows by specified increment.

---

## Core Operations & Methods

```
vector.add(1);           // Add to end
vector.add(0, 5);        // Add at index
vector.get(1);           // Get by index
vector.set(1, 10);       // Replace at index
vector.remove(1);        // Remove by index
vector.size();           // Current number of elements
vector.capacity();       // Current capacity
vector.clear();          // Remove all elements
vector.contains(10);     // Check for element
vector.isEmpty();        // Check if empty
```

- Methods are similar to those offered by ArrayList and LinkedList.
- Unique to Vector: `capacity()` returns current capacity.

---

## Performance and Synchronization

| Feature                | Vector                | ArrayList             |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Thread Safety          | Yes (synchronized)    | No                    |
| Multi-threaded use     | Recommended           | Not recommended       |
| Single-threaded use    | Not recommended       | Recommended           |
| Resizing               | Doubles/can specify   | 1.5x default          |
| Performance (Single)   | Slower (due to locks) | Faster                |

- Synchronization ensures only one thread modifies the collection at a time.
- Can cause performance issues in single-threaded programs.

---

## Example: Thread Safety

```
// Two threads adding to ArrayList, may cause data loss (not thread-safe)
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
// Thread1 and Thread2 both add numbers: final size may be less than expected.

// Using Vector: thread-safe; final size matches expected value
Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>();
// Thread1 and Thread2 both add numbers: final size is correct.
```

---

> **Vector** is a synchronized, dynamic array class in Java. Prefer ArrayList in single-threaded code, use Vector for thread-safe needs. Alternatives for modern concurrent use include CopyOnWriteArrayList, etc.

```

Here‚Äôs your GitHub-ready markdown file for Java Stack, named `Java_Stack_Notes.md`:

```markdown
# Java Stack Tutorial That Actually Makes Sense! üî• Never Be Confused Again

## What is Stack?

- **Stack** is a class in the Java Collection Framework, extends `Vector`.
- Represents a linear data structure following **LIFO** (Last In First Out).
- Example in real life: Stack of books, cookies‚Äîthe last added is the first removed.

---

## Key Concepts

- **LIFO Principle:** Last item added is the first one removed.
- **Thread-safety:** Inherits all synchronized methods from Vector.
- **Typical Use**: Useful for reversing, undo operations, recursion, parsing, etc.

---

## Core Stack Operations

```
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

stack.push(1);      // Add element to top
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);

int top = stack.peek();     // Look at top element (3)
int removed = stack.pop();  // Remove and return top (3)
boolean isEmpty = stack.isEmpty(); // Check if stack is empty
int size = stack.size();    // Number of elements
stack.search(2);            // Returns position from top (1-based)
```

- **push:** Add to the top
- **pop:** Remove and return the top
- **peek:** View (don‚Äôt remove) the top
- **isEmpty:** Check if empty
- **size:** Number of elements
- **search:** 1-based position from top

---

## Stack vs. Alternatives

| Feature              | Stack                    | Vector/ArrayList | LinkedList      |
|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Inherits from        | Vector                  | -                | -               |
| Thread-safe          | Yes                     | Vector: Yes, ArrayList: No | No      |
| Core usage           | LIFO                    | Sequence/List    | Sequence/List, can mimic stack/queue |
| Dedicated methods    | Yes (`push`, `pop`, `peek`) | No             | Yes (`addLast`, `removeLast`) |
| Insert/remove middle | Possible (via Vector)   | Yes              | Yes             |

- You can mimic stack using LinkedList or ArrayList (but not recommended).
- For modern and efficient stack operations, prefer **Deque/ArrayDeque**.

---

## Thread Safety & Performance

- Stack is synchronized.
- This is ideal for thread safety, but adds overhead in single-threaded use (for which LinkedList or ArrayDeque is recommended).

---

## Implementation Alternatives

- **LinkedList**: Effective stack using `addLast`, `removeLast`, `getLast`.
- **Deque/ArrayDeque**: Recommended for stack/queue tasks in contemporary Java.

---

> **Stack** in Java is perfect for LIFO structures and stack-related problems. For single-threaded performance, prefer LinkedList or ArrayDeque.
